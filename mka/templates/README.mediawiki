== Parker Lab Analysis: {{ANALYSIS_NAME}} ==

{{DESCRIPTION}}

The analysis is configured in <code>commands</code>. That script
should link the initial data into the analysis directory and generate
the pipeline commands into the file <code>pipeline</code>, which is
assumed to be a script that will be submitted to your local
distributed resource manager with <code>drmr</code>.

The generated <code>Makefile</code> has several default targets to get
you started:

* <code>make pipeline</code> will generate the <code>pipeline</code> script.
* <code>make run</code> will submit the pipeline with <code>drmr</code>.
* <code>make cancel</code> will use <code>drmr</code>'s cancel script to cancel the running pipeline.
* <code>make clean</code> will remove the pipeline script, and the entire <code>data</code> and <code>work</code> directory.
* <code>make github_repo</code> will create a GitHub repository for the analysis and push the code there.
